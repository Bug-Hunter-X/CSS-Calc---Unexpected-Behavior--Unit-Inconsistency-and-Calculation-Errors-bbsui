The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can produce unexpected results if not used carefully. For example, if you try to use `calc()` with multiple units (e.g., `calc(100% - 50px)`), the browser may interpret the calculation incorrectly if the units are not consistent. Another issue occurs when the browser is not able to evaluate the expression. In this case, the computed value of the CSS property will likely be `auto` or `0`, without any error message or warning. This can lead to subtle, hard-to-debug rendering problems.
